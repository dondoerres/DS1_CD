     We invited members of the Deep Space 1 project to record such
thoughts for posterity as their experiences on DS1, their hopes for DS1
and the future of space exploration we are trying to help enable, their
prediction for the mass of the Higgs boson, or expressions of their
innermost personal feelings that they wouldn't mind sharing with the
entire solar system.  Following are responses from those who took
advantage of this opportunity to archive a few cogitations and send them
to...well, time will tell!




Hello? Is anyone out there? Please let us know. It's important.

way for those who will follow.

Congrats on retreiving this old (4U) / 'new' (4us) technology validation
craft;  if U r reading this from the original Deep Space 1 CD-ROM, then
it has probably survived through extended mission and comet(s)
encounter; is America still around, and how much of the world survived
the 'Y2k' prob.? :-) e-mail jc101@usa.net if that technology is still
around....

May DS1 fulfill our dreams and hopes we put into this mission and become
a messenger and symbol of the spirit of space exploration in the New
Millennium, a shining example of technological progress.  May DS1 be an
inspiration for future generations to explore remote worlds in and
beyond our Solar System - worlds so much different from our own and yet
so much part of our reality, worlds that hold our past and our future.

untethered words float
free of gravity
beyond orbit
past recall

sizeless things, words
small as microbes
big as the mind

these microbes are off to infect...
whom?

A Message in a Bottle from the YES Program

        The 1998 Young Engineers and Scientists (YES) Program at
Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, USA, Earth, declares
that the Deep Space 1 Mission is meant to satisify our curiosity and
spirit of adventure about the universe around us.  We come in peace.
The reason we are conducting this experiment is to perform tests to
validate new technologies and to collect data in a scientifically
significant manner using these new advances in technology for
investigating small bodies of our solar system. In essence the mission
is an outreach for an exciting opportunity for enlightenment of our
knowledge of space.
        We are approaching a new millennium, a rare event in our
measurement of time, that we hope will be a major turning point for the
improvement of our civilization.  Our hopes and aspirations travel with
this spacecraft for the enlightenment of our species.  These ideals have
spawned a space exploration program called New Millennium that is
responsible for this spacecraft mission.
        We would love to know what you are like and what you have
discovered. If you are capable of intergalactic travel, how is it done?
Have you ever ventured to Earth and, if so, have you ever abducted any
human for medical reasons or just for fun?  Do you communicate through a
spoken language or is it more advanced than that, if so how?  Are there
any questions you have that we might be able to answer for you?  Let our
two worlds unite in purpose for each other's benefit.
        We have a tradition on Earth between two people, called "pen
pals," separated by great distances for exchanging written
communication.  Please be our "pen pal" and send a message to us at the
YES Program!  Better yet, come visit us.  We'll be waiting!

We sent this into space because we are curious, and satisfying our
curiosity is what we do to learn about the universe we live in.

     In many ways, this project is a personally rewarding journey.  I
hope my work proves worthy of the great privilege I have in stewarding
precious national resources.  The space science missions that Deep Space
1 enables will teach us much about the cosmos.  That future science as
well as the technological advancements and the science on this mission
all stir my imagination and fill me with pride and excited anticipation.
As a lifelong enthusiast of science and space exploration, it is truly
wonderful to participate in turning fantasy into reality.  As these
brief thoughts journey through space, it is all even more meaningful to
know that rich thoughts of my beloved wife Jan accompany them.
