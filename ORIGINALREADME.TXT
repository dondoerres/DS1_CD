Welcome to the DS1 CD!

Many, many people from all over the world have contributed their
time and talent to the creation of this CD.

The folks at Market Evolution helped to have young people at dozens
of Boys and Girls clubs contribute there time and talents to drawing
pictures to be included.

The staff people of JPL and at Spectrum Astro have contributed their
comments.

Images are stored in JPG format.  Other files are HTML and (like
this file) plain text, viewable on any computer that can read ISO
9660 CD ROM files.  Your web browser (such as Netscape Navigator or
Internet Explorer) is suitable for viewing any of these files.

A few of the earliest contributed images are in PDF format, viewable
by any computer with an Acrobat (version 3 or higher) viewer.

Installers for Windows 3.1 and Win95 Acrobat Readers (for PDF files)
are included on this CD.  These are in the READER\16BIT and
READER\32BIT directories.  The JPG files can also be viewed with the
included QUICKTIME viewer, distributed with the Acrobat Readers.

Acrobat Readers for other platforms are
available free from the Internet at http://www.adobe.com

The Boys and Girls Clubs contributions are indexed in the file
INDEX.HTM, which will tell you which DS1\GROUP directory to check
for the group you are seeking.  We included as many pictures as
possible.  A few, regretably, got separated from their parent group.
Most of these are in one of the SPECIAL GROUPS.

PDF files are all in the PDF directory.

Files readable with your web browser are SPECTRUM.HTM, JPL.TXT,
and FUTURE.TXT.

Enjoy!
