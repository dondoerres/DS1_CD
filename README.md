# DS1_CD
This is a copy of a CD carried by the DS1 spacecraft.
(Think of the Voyager mission gold record updated with 1998 technology)
A number of CD's and DVD's were carried on the DS1 spacecraft,
representing various groups working on the DS-1 mission as
a message to the stars.
DS-1 was launched October 24, 1998.
This is a copy of the contents of the CD put together by Spectrum Astro, the prime contractor
for the spacecraft and portions of the spacecraft electronics.  
I was responsible for the creation of the original CD.
These files represent the contents of the original CD.
Not include from the original cd are the CD autostart files and
an installer for a 1998 vintage Acrobat Reader.

I see no particular copyright notices on any of the material, 
and no deliberate violations of intellectual property are intended.
This is all assumed public domain.
